   CONSTANTS — world sizing + custom-asset manifest.

   ASSETS: set a url to null to keep the built-in procedural version. Files
   live next to index.html (models/ + textures/). Tune scale/rot/lift by eye.
   OBJ_SCALE multiplies everything that stands on the ground.

   FACING CONVENTION: +Z is forward for everything that moves. All movement
   code steers with atan2(dx, dz) and steps along (sin y, cos y), and the
   procedural creatures are all modelled nose-at-+Z. So rotY on a creature must
   leave its nose pointing +Z — a wrong rotY makes the animal travel tail-first
   rather than merely look rotated. Static scenery (tree/barn/crystal) has no
   facing and rotY there is purely cosmetic.

   only 1000px, so zooming it as far would just magnify blur. The values below

   up. Retune if you swap in higher-resolution art.
