   ENV — device detection + mutable runtime flags.

   Native ES modules can't reassign an imported binding, so every flag that
   changes at runtime (post-fx fallback, view radius) lives as a PROPERTY on
   the exported `env` object. Mutate env.X anywhere; all importers see it live.

   Asset quality is decided here, once, from the device — there is no user
   toggle. Desktop loads the custom GLB/texture set; phones and tablets use the
   built-in procedural geometry, which is the difference between a snappy run
   and downloading ~200MB of models onto a phone.
