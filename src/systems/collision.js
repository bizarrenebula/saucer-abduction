/* =========================================================================
   COLLISION — the ship is solid against trees and barns.

   Objects opt in by setting userData.solid, and carry a measured horizontal
   radius (u.rad) and height above their base (u.top) from measureSolid().
   The test is a cylinder overlap: close enough horizontally AND low enough
   vertically. Cylinders rather than boxes because the ship yaws constantly and
   both trees and the saucer are roughly radially symmetric.

   Cloak does not help here — it hides you from humans and hazards that aim at
   you, but a tree is not aiming.
